- 3 txt files with 3 different categories
- In the main menu choose which categories you want to pull questions from
    - you can do all the categories, two, or just one
- pull random questions from all of the categories selected
- in single player the player has 3 lives and tries to get as many questions right as possible
    - high score is saved in a txt file so that it can be saved even after the program ends 
- in multiplayer:
    - it runs through one player's run (one life) and they see how many answers they can get
    - then goes to the second player and does the same thing, but shows the target score
    - if the second player exceeds the target score without getting a question wrong they win

this will all run in a gui of some sort - we can make it look pretty 
- not exactly sure what to use for the graphics though, whatever it is it probably has to run on dr thomas' computer with no set up... maybe
- for now though we can get all these parts working and then worry about the gui later
    - just use print statements for now to make sure everything is working as intended
