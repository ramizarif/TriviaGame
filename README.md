# TriviaGame
University of Louisville Project that involves creating a Trivia Game

Hey guys, this is Ramiz. I created this repo so we can all work on the trivia game and see the changes we have going on
I hope to plan out a bunch of the code in a certain file so we can all assign ourselves to different tasks
Make sure you pseudo code a good amount just so we know what we all are doing and can easily reference it for write ups later
