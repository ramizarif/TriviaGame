    - only adding ten questions for now, but we can add more later, right now using for testing
- The current format is Question,RightAnswer,WrongAnswer,WrongAnswer,WrongAnswer
 - Also I made the trivia.py file and described some high level functions that will definetly be needed to get the game functional
    - these functions can be done independently so there should be no blockages and anyone can get started on any of them
